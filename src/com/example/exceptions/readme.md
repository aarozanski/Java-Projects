Step 1: 
The Student Class
The Student class is designed to model a student with two fields: name and age. It validates the input during object creation using a constructor.

Key Features:
Fields:
name: Stores the student's name.
age: Stores the student's age.
Constructor:
Validates the name and age using custom exceptions.
If invalid, it throws:
InvalidNameException if the name is null or empty.
InvalidAgeException if the age is not between 18 and 60.
Getters:
getName() and getAge() allow access to the student's details.

Step 2: 
The CustomExceptions Class
This file organizes all the custom exceptions we use to handle specific invalid cases.

Key Features:
InvalidNameException:
Thrown when the student's name is null or empty.
InvalidAgeException:
Thrown when the student's age is outside the allowed range (18-60).
CourseFullException:
Thrown when attempting to register more than 5 students in a course.
By creating custom exceptions, we ensure that invalid cases are clearly and explicitly handled.

Step 3: 
The CourseRegistration Class
This class manages the registration and unregistration of students for a course.

Key Features:
ArrayList for Storage:
Stores up to 5 registered students.
registerStudent(Student student):
Checks if the course is full. If so, throws CourseFullException.
Adds the student to the list if there’s space.
unregisterStudent(String name):
Removes a student by name from the list.
Throws an exception if the student is not found.
listStudents():
Displays all registered students and their details.
This class enforces the business rules of the course (e.g., maximum 5 students) and provides methods to manage student registrations.

Step 4: 
The Main Class
This is the entry point of the program where user interactions are handled. It uses a menu-based system to perform actions like registering and unregistering students.

Key Features:
Menu Options:
Register a student.
Unregister a student.
List all students.
Exit the program.
Exception Handling:
Ensures that invalid inputs or operations (e.g., invalid name, age, or trying to register more than 5 students) don’t crash the program.
Uses try-catch blocks to catch exceptions and display appropriate error messages.
Continued Execution:
After each operation, the program loops back to the menu, allowing continuous interaction until the user exits.

What This Program Teaches

Object-Oriented Design:
Encapsulation: The Student class encapsulates the details of a student and validates the data internally.
Custom Exceptions: Clear and meaningful error handling for invalid input scenarios.
Error Handling:
Prevents invalid states by throwing exceptions for invalid data or operations.
Makes the system robust and user-friendly.
Reusability:
The Student and CourseRegistration classes can be reused or extended for other applications.
Scalability:
Easily extendable to include more features, such as different courses or advanced validation.
